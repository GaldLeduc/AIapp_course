    "# An Endpoint using BERT large model (uncased) with the MS_MARCO dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a pre-trained language model that \n",
    "has achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks. BERT is a \n",
    "transformer-based model, which was fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including question answering. \n",
    "The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is one such task where BERT has achieved \n",
    "significant accuracy compared with other models. However, current research also indicates that \n",
    "tuning BERT with new datasets can lead to further improvements in its performances for specific \n",
    "tasks. In this proposal, we suggest fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT large model (uncased) with the \n",
    "ms_marco dataset using whole word masking and incorporating a fine-tuning approach to improve its \n",
    "performances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The BERT model is based on the concept of pre-training, as well as fine-tuning, a NLP task. The pre\u0002training process is based on unsupervised objectives, such as the masked language model and the \n",
    "next sentence prediction task, to learn contextual representations of words. The fine-tuning process, \n",
    "on the other hand, uses supervised training, where the learned pre-trained knowledge is combined \n",
    "with task-specific datasets to achieve beƩer performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "MS_MARCO is a dataset consisting of a large collection of real-world queries and corresponding \n",
    "passages that aims to facilitate research in question-answer matching and ranking. It contains more \n",
    "than 1 million queries and over 8 million passages, making it one of the largest publicly available \n",
    "datasets of its kind. Each query in the dataset was generated by real users of the Bing search engine \n",
    "and is paired with relevant passages retrieved from web pages. The dataset is designed to enable \n",
    "researchers to develop and evaluate machine learning models for natural language processing tasks \n",
    "such as question answering, information retrieval, and passage ranking. The dataset also includes \n",
    "information about the relevance of passages to queries, allowing for the evaluation of ranking \n",
    "algorithms. Overall, the MS MARCO v1.2 dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in \n",
    "developing and evaluating algorithms for natural language understanding tasks.\n",

    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposal is to use the BERT large model (uncased) with the MS_MARCO dataset using whole \n",
    "word masking as an endpoint to answer question. For this we will go through the following steps: \n",
    "* Preparing the data: We will use the MS_MARCO dataset to fine-tune the BERT large model. We will construct a train and test set from the available dataset for fine-tuning. \n",
    "* Fine-tuning the model: We will fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model with the MS_MARCO dataset using whole word masking. We will use the Adam optimizer for training and evaluate model performance based on F1 score. \n",
    "* Evaluating the model: We will evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance based on MS_Marco's benchmarking metrics. The key evaluation measures will be the F1-score and the exact match (EM) score. \n",
    "* Deploy the model. \n",
    "* Scale the model so that we can make this application available to a lot more users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you are going to use Sagemaker in a local environment. You need access to an IAM Role with the required permissions for Sagemaker. You can find here more about it.*"
